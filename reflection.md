# Reflection

**About the project:**
Cyber bullying is a growing problem in today’s digital world. While the internet world can feel disconnected from reality, the words we type and the comments we make can have an actual and long-term influence on others. This project is to serve as a call to action and hope to encourage viewers to reflect on their own digital behavior and consider the impact of their words online.

**Process:**  
During the in-class generative loop writing exercise, cyberbullying was the first thing that came to mind. I immediately thought of an image of knives shaped like a keyboard pointing at someone. At first, I was thinking to have a person using a phone with the keyboard knives aimed at them, but later decided that having knives coming out directly from the cellphone would better convey the message to viewers. After finalizing this idea, I listed the image sources I needed (keyboard, knife, cellphone, person) and collected them from Unsplash. Since I had no prior photo editing experience, I relied on tutorials to learn the basics. I also added a few screenshots of my progress to my final visual argument in [Progress]( https://github.com/wex59/visual-argument-2025spring/tree/main/Progress)

**Baseline Criteria:**  
For the Baseline Criteria, I ensured my work met all requirements. I used arrangement, size, and color to direct viewers' attention, explained my compositional choices in this reflection, and conveyed a clear visual argument with a font that matches the tone. I credited all assets correctly, used at least three layers, applied tools beyond basic selection and text, included meaningful commit messages, and met all deadlines.

**Aspirational Inspirations: **
I believe I met most of the aspirational requirements. I organized my project file using labeled layers, layer groups for clarity and used several principles of visual design:
1. Balance (Symmetry): My background maintains symmetry, with both sides equally weighted. Even though it used a gradient, I ensured visual balance by matching the sizing and spacing of elements on both sides.

2. Figure-Ground Ambiguity(equally sized elements / containers): The black and white sections are equally sized, with matching text background to avoid one side dominating the other.

3. Proximity: On the “badSide,” I clustered knives of different sizes to create a grouped effect. On the “goodSide,” I placed multiple small images closely together, differing in size but are clustered closely, creating a similar effect.

4. Similarity: For the “goodSide,” I used a light purple color to connect the phone, text and most small images, helping viewers perceive them as a cohesive whole.

5. Contrast: I purposely have the “badSide” title white against a black background, while the “goodSide” title is black on white to create a contrast and better readability.

6. Hierarchy: To guide focus between layers, I blurred the text background on both sides using the lens blur tool, making key elements like the title and the grouped element to stand out.

According to the font reading I applied the techniques that use a single font for the whole infographic and create contrast with a bold version of the font. I purposely bolded the important word from the title(e.g. WEAPON, TOOL) to create a contrast that makes them stand out from the others.

Based on class feedback, my visual argument is bold and eye-catching. I also included a resource at the bottom for further information. My work contains more than three overlapping layers and uses multiple advanced tools beyond selection, move, and text. For more details, my repository includes a toolAndEffectUsed.md file. Given the feedback received, I believe my message and intended audience are effectively conveyed through my piece.

# Conclusion
I'm really happy with how my final project turned out. This was my first experience with photo editing, and using GIMP was a great learning opportunity. Although I started with no prior experience, I was able to explore different tools, experiment with design principles, and bring my vision to life. Throughout the process, I gained a deeper understanding of composition, contrast, and visual storytelling. Overall, this project was a rewarding experience, and I’m proud of the final result!
